1. Project Setup
    Task: Set up your development environment.
    Subtasks:
        - Install Python, Hugging Face Transformers, PostgreSQL, and Docker.
        - Create a virtual environment and install necessary Python libraries (transformers, pandas, sqlalchemy, etc.).
        - Download the dataset from Hugging Face: ei_oc_unstructured.

2. Data Understanding and Preprocessing

    Task: Explore and preprocess the dataset.
    Subtasks:
        - Load the dataset and examine the structure (i.e., columns instruction and output).
        - Perform basic data cleaning (e.g., remove duplicates, handle missing values).
        - Tokenize the text data from the instruction column to prepare it for model input.

3. Model Selection and Fine-Tuning
    Task: Choose and fine-tune a Transformer model.
    Subtasks:
        - Select the deepset/roberta-base-squad2 model from Hugging Face.
        - Fine-tune the model using the dataset:
        - Input: instruction column.
        - Output: output column (ratings).
        - Evaluate the model's performance on a validation set.

4. Data Extraction Using the Model
    Task: Use the fine-tuned model to extract structured data.
    Subtasks:
        - Run the model on the instruction data to extract ratings or any other structured information.
        - Post-process the model output to align it with a SQL-compliant structure.

5. Database Schema Design
    Task: Design a database schema for the structured data.
    Subtasks:
    - Define the tables and fields (e.g., tweet_id, emotion, rating, tweet_text).
    - Create the schema in PostgreSQL.

6. Data Insertion into SQL
    Task: Insert the structured data into the SQL database.
    Subtasks:
        - Write scripts to insert the extracted data into the corresponding tables.
        - Ensure data integrity and consistency by validating entries.

7. Containerization with Docker
    - Task: Containerize the entire application for easy deployment.
    - Subtasks:
        - Create a Dockerfile including the environment, model, and database setup.
        - Build and test the Docker container locally.

8. Testing and Validation
    Task: Test the pipeline with various data samples.
    Subtasks:
        - Verify the pipeline's performance by running new Twitter posts through it.
        - Compare the SQL outputs against expected results to ensure accuracy.

9. Deployment on Cloud
    Task: Deploy the pipeline on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, GCP).
    Subtasks:
        - Set up cloud services (e.g., AWS RDS for PostgreSQL, ECS for Docker).
        - Deploy the Docker container and ensure it interacts correctly with the database.
